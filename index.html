    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I lead a multidisciplinary incubator space focused on developing and validating the next
      generation of neurotechnologies that bridge fundamental discovery and real-world application.
      Within the Carnegie Mellon ecosystem and through close collaborations with
      <strong>Prof. Maysam Chamanzar</strong> and <strong>Prof. Pulkit Grover</strong>,
      my research program integrates neuroscience, engineering, and clinical insight to create tools
      that advance how we sense, stimulate, and interface with the brain and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to translate cutting-edge research into practical, impactful neurotechnologies from minimally invasive brain-stimulation systems and high-density neural interfaces to innovative optical imaging and sensing platforms. By combining rigorous scientific methods 
      with a translational mindset, this work aims to address unmet needs in neuroscience, neurology, pain medicine, and human health.
