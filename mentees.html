    <h2>My Mentees</h2>
    <p>
        I have had the privilege of mentoring undergraduate, master's, and PhD students in neuroengineering,
        neuromodulation, optical imaging, and electrophysiology. Below are some of the students I have worked with.

            Lloyd is a PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University as a part of Chamanzar Lab in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. His research mainly focuses on designing in situ sculpted waveguides for light delivery and imaging of biological tissue. His projects also span system integration between complex lensing systems and imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography. Lloyd also enjoys outdoor activities like playing soccer and hiking in the summer. He also enjoys his time indoors playing the legend of zelda games on a nintendo switch in winters,
            assisting with spike sorting, current source density mapping, and visualization of TES-evoked responses.

            Example: Led a project on optical imaging using the Microimager platform, including animal preparation,
            imaging protocol optimization, and image processing for calcium and hemodynamic signals.
