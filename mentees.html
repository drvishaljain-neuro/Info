    <h2>My Mentees</h2>
    <p>
        I have had the privilege of mentoring undergraduate, master's, and PhD students in neuroengineering,
        neuromodulation, optical imaging, and electrophysiology. Below are some of the students I have worked with.

        <div class="mentee-name">Lloyd Lobo</div>
        <div class="mentee-role">Doctorate Student</div>
        <div class="mentee-desc">
            Lloyd is a PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University as a part of Chamanzar Lab in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. His research mainly focuses on designing in situ sculpted waveguides for light delivery and imaging of biological tissue. His projects also span system integration between complex lensing systems and imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography.
