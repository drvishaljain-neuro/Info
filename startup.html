            <h3>Our Vision &amp; Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Synapse Symphony is building a precision neuromodulation platform to provide safer, more accessible
                alternatives to traditional deep brain stimulation and chronic pain pharmacotherapy. By combining
                high-density stimulation, intelligent current steering, and data-driven personalization, we aim to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deliver clinically meaningful pain relief and functional improvement without invasive implants.</li>
                <li>Enable clinicians to configure and personalize therapy at the level of networks, not just single targets.</li>
                <li>Reduce barriers to access by designing systems suitable for both clinic and at-home use.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Entrepreneurship &amp; Industry Leadership</h2>

        <p class="startup-intro">
            As Co-Founder and COO of Synapse Symphony Inc., I work at the interface of engineering, clinical practice,
            and business. My focus is to convert high-fidelity neuromodulation research into products that can be
            evaluated by clinicians, reimbursed by payers, and adopted at scale.
        </p>

        <h3>Building Synapse Symphony Inc.</h3>
        <p>
            Synapse Symphony grew out of collaborative work at Carnegie Mellon University on ultra-high-density
            transcranial and minimally invasive stimulation. I have been involved from inception in defining the
            company’s clinical focus, technology roadmap, and commercialization strategy, with an emphasis on chronic
            pain and functional recovery.
        </p>

        <h3>My Role as COO</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commercial Strategy:</strong> Defining product offerings, clinical use-cases, pricing, and positioning across pain clinics, rehabilitation centers, and health systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Leadership:</strong> Coordinating FDA strategy (Q-Sub/Pre-Sub, De Novo vs 510(k)), aligning development with regulatory expectations, and working with external consultants.</li>
            <li><strong>Clinical Translation:</strong> Designing early feasibility studies, pilot protocols, and site engagement for chronic pain and neuro-rehabilitation indications.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Integration:</strong> Connecting hardware, software, and stimulation algorithms into a unified product, with clear requirements for safety, usability, and manufacturability.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor &amp; Partner Engagement:</strong> Leading technical narratives, pitch decks, diligence responses, and strategic discussions with payers, clinical partners, and industry collaborators.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Execution:</strong> Managing timelines, budgets, grant milestones, vendor relationships, and documentation to keep research, engineering, and regulatory activities aligned.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Milestones</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>DARPA Embedded Entrepreneur Initiative award, supporting commercialization strategy and regulatory de-risking.</li>
            <li>Participation in clinically focused accelerators such as AlphaLab Health, with structured guidance on go-to-market, reimbursement, and clinical validation.</li>
            <li>Development of staged product roadmap: software-driven personalization layer leveraging existing FDA-cleared hardware, followed by integrated neuromodulation hardware.</li>
            <li>Structured interviews with clinicians, health system stakeholders, and payer representatives to refine indications, workflows, and value propositions.</li>
            <li>Ongoing work on IP strategy and licensing with Carnegie Mellon University to support long-term defensibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Broader Industry &amp; Commercialization Experience</h3>
        <p>
            Beyond Synapse Symphony, my work frequently involves bridging academic research with translational and
            industry requirements. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Co-developing proposals and studies that align clinical endpoints, technical feasibility, and payer expectations.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with payers and consultants to understand coverage pathways, health-economic considerations, and evidence requirements.</li>
            <li>Supporting IP generation, provisional patent drafting, and licensing strategies for neurotechnology platforms.</li>
            <li>Advising on integration of neuromodulation systems into existing clinical workflows and infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Forward Focus</h3>
        <p>
            The long-term goal is to establish a robust pipeline for translating neuromodulation research into regulated,
            clinically impactful products. This requires simultaneous attention to engineering rigor, biological insight,
            patient experience, and system-level constraints—a combination that shapes both my scientific and
            entrepreneurial work.
