  <h2>Synapse Symphony Inc.</h2>
  <p>
    Synapse Symphony Inc. is a Carnegie Mellon University–born neurotechnology startup dedicated to
    developing next-generation neuromodulation systems that are <strong>non-invasive or minimally
    invasive</strong>, yet capable of engaging deep and distributed brain networks with precision.
    Our goal is to provide safer, more effective alternatives to conventional deep brain stimulation
    and systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic pain and other neurological disorders.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="startup-mission">
  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    We are building a platform of <strong>precision neuromodulation technologies</strong> that can be
    deployed in real-world clinical environments and, ultimately, in patients’ homes. By combining
    high-density stimulation hardware, intelligent current steering, and closed-loop sensing, we aim to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Address unmet needs in <strong>chronic pain</strong>, motor recovery, and neuropsychiatric disorders.</li>
    <li>Bridge the gap between <strong>non-invasive stimulation and deep brain stimulation</strong>.</li>
    <li>Offer clinicians tools that are <strong>scalable, configurable, and workflow-compatible</strong>.</li>
    <li>Create therapies that are <strong>more accessible, comfortable, and sustainable</strong> for patients.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="startup-platform">
  <h3>Technology Platform</h3>
  <p>
    Synapse Symphony’s platform builds on years of research in high-density electrical stimulation,
    flexible neural interfaces, and multimodal neurophysiology. Key elements include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>High-Density Epicranial Stimulation (uHD-TES):</strong>
      electronically steerable current patterns delivered through dense arrays
      to focus fields on deep and distributed targets while remaining non-invasive.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimally Invasive Deep Access:</strong>
      floating micro-wire bundles and related concepts designed to couple surface-delivered
      currents into specific deep structures with reduced tissue disruption.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Integrated Sensing &amp; Analytics:</strong>
      EMG, behavioral, and electrophysiological readouts combined with signal
      processing and machine learning to inform closed-loop neuromodulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Software-Defined Therapy:</strong>
      programmable stimulation paradigms and clinician-facing software to
      configure protocols, monitor responses, and personalize treatment.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="startup-indications">
  <h3>Initial Clinical Focus</h3>
  <p>
    Our initial indication space is centered on <strong>chronic pain</strong> and related functional
    limitations, where existing options often require systemic medications, implanted stimulators,
    or repeated invasive procedures. In close collaboration with clinical partners, we are working to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Map stimulation targets in networks underlying musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain.</li>
    <li>Refine stimulation paradigms that balance efficacy, comfort, and safety.</li>
    <li>Design trials that are aligned with <strong>payer and regulatory expectations</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Role as Co-Founder &amp; COO</h3>
  <p>
    As Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Synapse Symphony Inc., I lead the
    <strong>translation pipeline</strong> from academic prototypes to clinically and commercially
    viable products. My responsibilities include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Biological &amp; Preclinical Validation:</strong>
      designing and overseeing experiments in ex vivo, rodent, and human cadaver models
      to evaluate safety, focality, and efficacy of our stimulation platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Clinical &amp; Regulatory Strategy:</strong>
      coordinating with clinicians and regulatory experts to plan early feasibility
      studies, de-risk FDA pathways (e.g., 510(k)/IDE), and align with standards
      for safety, performance, and quality systems.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-Functional Execution:</strong>
      managing collaboration between engineering, neuroscience, clinical, and
      operations teams to keep development milestones on track.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Commercialization &amp; Partnerships:</strong>
      engaging with health systems, innovation programs, and strategic partners
      to shape our go-to-market strategy and explore reimbursement and adoption models.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Drawing on my background in both molecular neuroscience and neuroengineering, I work to ensure
    that each design choice is grounded in <strong>biological insight, clinical relevance, and
    real-world constraints</strong>.
